    <h3>So Simple, So Good</h3>
    <p>What is it about butter chicken (or murgh makhani in Hindi) that makes it loved by children and adults alike? It is like a big hug. A must-order item on an Indian restaurant menu, this home-cooked version has all the same complexity of flavour, yet it’s so simple to make yourself. Tender chicken swims in a tomato sauce flavoured with sweet spices such as cumin, coriander and garam masala, and it’s finished with a generous slug of cream.</p>
    <p>So what makes our recipe such a delicious curry? In any authentic butter chicken, the chicken is left to marinate in a mixture of yoghurt and spices for hours before cooking. The yoghurt makes the chicken super tender, while the spices penetrate it and give it much more depth of flavour. While the sauce isn’t JUST made from butter, it is made up of a beautiful blend of rich ingredients: the yoghurt from the marinade, stock, tomato and cream.</p>
